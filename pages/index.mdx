### Introduction

`func` is a modern command line framework that is lighter and more elegant compared with other products,
with more scaffolding support and an excellent developer experience at the same time.

`func` is realized by using `TypeScript`, which is easier to maintain and extend. Due to type support,
you can get almost all the grammar tips. But don't worry, it's not complicated,
only one command is required from development to packaging.

You can create a project in seconds with <NextLink href="/guide"><Link color>Quick-start Guide.</Link></NextLink>

- Elegant grammar and without any thinking burden

- Very few dependence, maximum optimized running speed and `npm` download time

- Project template support

### Why

For the `func`, using the decorator's metadata to help command define is a very lightweight choice actually,
**when most of the codes will not be brought into the running after the build**,
it also provides a very good development experience. (such as tips, types, etc.)

If you have any items that need to be rebuilt or started with a new item from the very beginning,
then `func` is a very good choice, making the command-line tool built in a happy and simple manner with rich spirituality.

### Create Command

In `func`, creating a command is very simple, you just need to add `Command` annotations for any class:

<Display width="500px" caption={<>Create a command in file <Code>apple.ts</Code></>}>

```ts
@Command({
  name: 'apple',
})
export class MyFirstCommand {
  constructor() {
    console.log('ok')
  }
}
```

</Display>

Assuming the name of your command line tool is `hello-func`, you only need to run `hello-func apple` and the terminal will display `ok`.
Everything is achieved in this way.

### Create Option

We know that there are usually some top-level options for command-line tools too.
Taking your "tools" as an example, you may want its functions, such as `<command> --version` and so on available for support.

Here, we can use the `Option` decorator to realize very elegantly:

<Display width="500px" caption={<>Create a option command in file <Code>version.ts</Code></>}>

```ts
import { Option } from 'func'

@Option({
  name: 'version',
  alias: 'v',
})
export class Version {
  constructor() {
    console.log('1.0.0')
  }
}
```

</Display>

After adding some information to your class `Version`, it will be triggered when `--version` and `-v`, `-v` is its alias.

The `func` allows you to create aliases for any command.
if it is an alias for the `Option` command, only a `-` is required to use it, which is also standard.

### Create Sub-options

Inside the func, a decorator `SubOptions` is also ready for you to implement this type of command `<command> --<option>`:

<Display width="500px" caption={<>Create a command containing suboption in file <Code>apple.ts</Code></>}>

```ts
@Command({
  name: 'apple',
})
@SubOptions([{ name: 'help', alias: 'h' }])
export class MyFirstSubOption {
  constructor(private arg: CommandArgsProvider) {
    if (arg.option.help) {
      console.log('HELP MESSAGE: The apple is red')
    }
  }
}
```

</Display>

Refer to the chapter of [Parameters](/params.md) for how to get the values of options.

### Create Main Command

The main command refers to that scenario that only the name of your command line is run without carrying any parameters:

```ts
import { CommandMajor } from 'func'

@CommandMajor()
export class Main {}
```

If your tool of command lines is still called `hello-func`, then just running `hello-func` will trigger the main command.

### Get Missing Command

In a few cases, users may enter parameters or commands incorrectly.
You need to guide the user with some tips of information kindly given. `CommandMissing` is used to solve this problem.
Without any `Command` or `Option` found, being unable to be found will be triggered:

```ts
import { CommandMissing } from 'func'

@CommandMissing()
export class Missing {
  constructor() {
    console.log('not found any commands!')
  }
}
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
